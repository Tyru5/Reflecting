Project 5 README file



(1) => I have created a Makefile that compiles my program into an executable called: 'geonorm' (lowercase 'g' because of the directions).
       To compile my program, type in: 'make all', which will then compile and link each class individually. If it was a successful compilation, a
       -- Success message print out at the bottom. If a recompile is necessary, type: 'make clean all', which will remove all the .o files as well as the current
       executable name and then recompile all individual classes again.

(2) => To execute my program, type in the executable name (which ./geonorm ) with a given .ply file. This will print out certain information regarding the .ply and
       write two files into the current directory. One file will be _centered.ply and the other will be _rounded.ply respectively.

This was an awesome assignment!

Best,
Tyrus Malmstrom.
